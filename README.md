Things to add to the engine:
---------
> 1. Insert game inside the engine
2. Better scratchpad support
3. Better textures (reading, blitting, basic image processing)
4. Some way to seperate Game and Engine data
5. Add higher level rendering constructs (Shaders, materials, meshes, transforms)
6. Add some form of automatic shader selection
7. Add some form of primitives(Rectangle, circles, spheres, triangles)
8. More flexible transform class(Default values for projection and camera)
9. Non-perspective views (Orthogonal views)
10. Texture manipulation (Translation, rotation, scale)
11. More control over textures(filtering, formatting etc.)
12. More friendly constructors(Camera)
13. Window should have more properties (Center position, fullscreen, maybe mouse locking)
14. Better Vector math(normalisation, +=, commonly used vector constants, swizzling support)
15. Options class/system, some place to read values that the player chooses
16. Centralised "level" or "scene" class that holds the data that the game is using
17. Game object class
18. Make naming consistent
19. Eventually make easier way to generate Mesh
20. Eventually make easier way of generating texture coordinates
21. Vector swizzling
